      <p>
      I Studied Computer Engineering in <a href="https://www.uc.cl/">Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile</a>. 
      Then I did a Masters in Computer Science, in the same university. 
      My thesis was about using Automata to efficiently manage a streaming database, more in detail, about adding time window operators to the language and processing them with time automata.

      While I studied and did my masters, I worked part time at a small company for four years.
